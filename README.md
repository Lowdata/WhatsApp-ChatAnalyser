                        as 'the', 'a', 'an', 'in'). In order to get insightful
                        most common word mentioned in the chat, we need to
                        skip these type of word. The Allowed values are:
                        arabic, bulgarian, catalan, czech, danish, dutch,
                        english, finnish, french, german, hebrew, hindi,

                        raw text. One word for every line
```
### Stop Words
----------------------
I've included stop words for several languages from https://github.com/Alir3z4/stop-words.
You can use your own stop word file.
Just use `-c` argument followed by filepath.
One word for each file like below
```
able
ableabout
about
above
abroad
abst
```


### Notes
----------------------
- This script uses regex to extract the data.
- Currently supports the chat pattern below:
 ```python
    "14/10/18, 11:16 - Contact Name: this is a message"
    "2/30/18, 2:07 AM - Contact Name:  Test👌"
    "[30/12/18 4.59.25 PM] Nama User: 🙏test"
    "[06/07/17 13.23.30] ‪+62 123-456-78910‬: image omitted"
  ```
- Some date formats may not be supported
